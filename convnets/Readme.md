# Convolutional Network Folder

Welcome to the convolutional networks for handwriting recognition folder. In here, there are several folders, with the descriptions as follows:

* exnet - Example network. This is where you should probably start. Take a look through it. You'll learn how to ingest data.
* fielnet - Network based on Stefan Fiel's work
