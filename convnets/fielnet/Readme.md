### Stefan Fiel's Deep Neural Network (Absent Feature Extractor)

To train, use fielnet.ipynb. This will save models

To load the net in, call fielload.ipynb.

Notes:
* No X-Validation
* Accuracy Train 79.05%
* Shard into lines at 120x120
* Did not run with Yonas's minibatcher. Used my own custom ingest.
