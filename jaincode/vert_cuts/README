*Requires 64-bit Linux 6.2 or similar to run
*Assumes binarized, 1 bit input similar to the example dataset

Features Extraction:
Usage: ./vert_feature_extract [image] [output feature file]

Feature Comparison
Usage: ./compare [file1] [file2] [output scorefile]

Example output and scores are given in the examples dir to verify that the code is working as expected.

./vert_feature_extract ../example_input/027_1.tif example_output/027_1.tif.fea
./vert_feature_extract ../example_input/027_2.tif example_output/027_2.tif.fea
./compare example_output/027_1.tif.fea example_output/027_2.tif.fea example_output/027_score

score file should read:
0.735547

Description:
This approach splices words into "character-like" segments using vertical cuts. These segments are described using gradients taken from their contour to form a feature vectors. These features are clustered to find a representative "character" set.  Sets of feature vectors taken from the cluster centers from two images are compared to determine similarity. A more detailed explanation can be found in the ICDAR 2013 work "Writer Identification Using an Alphabet of Contour Gradient Descriptors" assuming it is accepted.
