"""
 Purpose: The main purpose is to demonstrate how to find the running median, mode and 
          mean over a sequence (list) of integers or reals or a mix of integers and reals.
          The secondary purpose, is to inspire Python programmers to explore some of
          the powerful packages (e.g. collections) available to the Python community and 
          to learn more about list comprehension and lambda functions.
    Note:        
       1. Much of the code here has been taken from code posted to the web (e.g. stackoverflow)
          by other Python programmers (e.g. Peter Otten)
